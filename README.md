# Sky Wars
Game created as coursework for Software Development module at Edinburgh Napier University.

Sky Wars is a game where the user takes control of a master ship. The master ship spawns in a
random place on the grid and can only move to a random neighbouring place afterwards by clicking 
a 'move' button. Every time the master ship moves, there is a 1 in 3 chance of an enemy ship 
spawning through the intergalactic black hole (the top left square in the grid), enemy ships can 
also only move to neighbouring squares when they move. If the master ship moves into the same square 
as an enemy ship, the enemy ship is destroyed and removed from the sky. If the master ship (while 
in defensive mode) moves into the same square as 2 or more enemy ships, the master ship is 
destroyed and the game is over, however if the master ship is in offensive mode, it will take 
3 or more enemy ships to destroy it.
